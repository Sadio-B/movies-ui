# Movies

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.8.

## Exercise statement

You will need to set up an UI from the stories below:
 1. An overview with a list of movies
 2. The ability to add a movie to the favorites
 3.  The possibility of displaying only the films in favorite
 4.  The possibility of putting a film in a viewing list, and selecting whether or not it has been seen afterwards
 5.  The possibility of displaying only the films watched/to be seen
 6. Display the rating in the form of stars (rounded to the whole number, but with the full number displayed next to it. For example: a film with a rating of 3.45 we put 3 stars but with 3.45 written next to it or elsewhere)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
